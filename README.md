# Trayway

So trayway is a self improvment and a day to day app , it is a app supposed to help you setting goals, tracking your habits and set your tasks for the day.
I'm developing Trayway alone as a  16 years old student. I'm using firebase api for the backend as i'm not familiar with backend, the languages are 
HTML, CSS and javascript. 
I started this project to  learn  more about javascrpit and web development . 
So if you got interested in the project you can help in some future bugs in stack overflow(https://stackoverflow.com/users/15440431/chicocosta4).
